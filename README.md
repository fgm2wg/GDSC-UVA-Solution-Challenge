# GDSC-UVA-Solution-Challenge

## Before Running
```{python}
pip install requirements.txt
```
or
```{python}
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To Run
  * Run app.py (must be running to use the website)
  * Note: The website runs off of the host computer's IP address so the link will be http://HOSTIPADDRESS:5000 after running the code

## Important Notes
 * Upon initially visiting the site, you'll find a minimalist layout featuring just two headers: "Available Donations" and "Requests," along with a prompt to Signup/Login for access. After providing a username and password to sign up, you'll be prompted to log in with your new credentials, granting access to the site's features. Once logged in, you can begin posting food items available for donation, along with your location, or make requests for specific food items at designated locations. These posts can be editted or deleted by the user. Additionally, a chat button located in the bottom left corner allows for direct messaging between users.
 * IMPORTANT: It's important to note that this site is not a final product; rather, it serves as a prototype for a community food sharing platform. Its purpose is to offer a basic interface for users to post requests and available donations of food in specific locations, addressing UN Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Donors can showcase their available items and location alongside their username, enabling those in need to connect with them directly to obtain the food they require. Requests for food maintain user privacy by not displaying the user's name, but individuals can utilize the chat feature to communicate directly with donors to privately discuss logistics and other essential information.
